# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithmic problems using various paradigms, demonstrating correctness, optimality, and complexity analysis.

## Contents

1. **Knapsack Problem**
   - Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)
   - 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
   - Compare Greedy vs DP for optimality

2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Single-source shortest path using Dynamic Programming
   - Verify time complexity

3. **N-Queens Problem**
   - Recursive solution using Backtracking
   - Place `n` queens so no two attack each other

4. **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
   - Solve using Least-Cost Branch & Bound
   - Print optimal path and cost

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and implement Greedy, DP, Backtracking, and Branch & Bound paradigms
- Compare algorithm strategies for correctness and efficiency
- Analyze and verify time and space complexity empirically
